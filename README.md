# Welcome to Cheeky Radio Pro 

## Background

Hi, I'm Gary! I am a full time developer, but love it so much I even do it as a hobby as well.

I am also a former radio producer. If I have to admit it, radio is my first love. So I thought I'd work on a Radio App.

I found Swift Radio but it didn't seem to work with newer versions of iOS software.


## So what does it do?

This code is written in swift 4.2 for iOS. The target iOS software is 12.1 running Xcode 10.

This is aimed specifically for the iPhone and has been tested on a simulator from iPhone 6 to iPhone XR.

## What do I need?

I have only worked with this using MacBook Air, running macOS Mojave.

You will need a copy of Xcode 10 and simulator installed on your system.

In theory Xcode should come with an inbuilt simulator.

You will need to create or login to download Xcode.

Failing that, you can download Xcode from the App Store.

If you are going to release the App onto the App Store you will need to have an Apple Developer account with a subscription of $99 a year.

You will also need to install Cocoapods.

## How do I get the app working?

Good question! The code is released free of charge. I have documented how to get the app working on CheekyFactor.com as premium content. To view this content you will need to register for a goPro account (it's only $2.95 a month), and this document explains how to get the environment ready, how to customize the App to your needs and more importantly, how to get your stream onto the App.

If you are not a technical person, I am more than happy to help you out. Please contact me via the CheekyFactor.com contacts page. I charge $250 a day for developing apps.

## Support

This code is released as is without warranty. If you require assistance you can ask for help on the discussion pages on CheekyFactor.com. I am extremely busy so I may not get chance to respond to queries posted on the forum. I am hoping a user community can be created on CheekyFactor.com for peer to peer support.

If you require direct support please contact me via the CheekyFactor.com contact page explaining what you want and I will advise of any fees associated with direct support.

I charge $200 a day for direct support.

## Ongoing releases

Invariably, Apple update the Swift and iOS releases, hence the App will need to be updated to when new releases come along. I will update the GIT repository, but there is no guarantee I will be able to keep on top of this.

If you want me to assist in ensuring your App is running to the latest Swift and iOS specifications, please contact me via the CheekyFactor.com contact page and I will be more than happy to assist.

I charge $250 a day for such tasks.

## And finally

If you appreciate the work I have done in getting this App working, please take into consideration it has taken me quite a bit of time to modify the code, so please consider buying me a beer via PayPal:
